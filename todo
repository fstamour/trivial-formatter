Issue:  SBCL loop printer is ugly especially use with :DO loop keyword.

E.g.

(LOOP :FOR (EXP . REST) :ON (FILE-EXP
                             (ASDF/COMPONENT:COMPONENT-PATHNAME COMPONENT))
      :DO (WHEN
              (AND (COMMENT-P EXP)
                   (NOT
                    (UIOP/UTILITY:STRING-PREFIX-P #\; (COMMENT-CONTENT EXP))))
            (WRITE-CHAR #\ )) (PRINT-AS-CODE EXP) (TYPECASE EXP
                                                    (BLOCK-COMMENT
                                                     (FORMAT T "~2%"))
                                                    (LINE-COMMENT
                                                     (TERPRI)
                                                     (WHEN
                                                         (NOT
                                                          (COMMENT-P
                                                           (CAR REST)))
                                                       (TERPRI)))
                                                    (CONDITIONAL (TERPRI))
                                                    (T
                                                     (TYPECASE (CAR REST)
                                                       (NULL)
                                                       (LINE-COMMENT
                                                        (IF (UIOP/UTILITY:STRING-PREFIX-P
                                                             #\;
                                                             (COMMENT-CONTENT
                                                              (CAR REST)))
                                                            (FORMAT T "~2%")))
                                                       (T (FORMAT T "~2%"))))))
