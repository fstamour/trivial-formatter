Issue:  About single semicolon line comment.
        e.g.

        (remove var seq ; Do not ever use DELETE!
                :key value
                :key value)

        may =>

        (remove var seq :key value :key ; Do not ever use DELETE!
                value)

        Ideally =>

        (remove var seq ; Do not ever use DELETE!
                :key value :key value)

Current tactics (i.e. print comment object as #\null as place holder, then replace it.)
is not able to resolve above issue.

New strategy is using pretty-printer for meta object.
